# ChooseYourAdventure

A GPT backed engine to generate a trip and highlight events in the US. 

You'll need:
An openai API key
An Rapid API api key 
And a serp API api key to generate all content

These apis should be stored in a config.json file outside of the ChooseYourOwnAdventure repo in a json file structured as so:

`{"openai_api_key": "OPENAI_API_KEY", "geo_api_key": "RAPID_API_KEY", "events_api_key": "SERP_API_KEY"}`
